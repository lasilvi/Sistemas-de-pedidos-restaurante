## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Documentation is consolidated by domain with canonical files
The repository SHALL maintain a canonical documentation structure where audit, quality, and technical-debt content are separated by domain and each domain has a primary maintained file set.

#### Scenario: Team updates project documentation
- **WHEN** contributors add or update deliverable documentation
- **THEN** audit evidence is written under `docs/auditoria/`
- **AND** quality/test evidence is written under `docs/quality/`
- **AND** technical debt is maintained in the technical-debt canonical document without mixing audit narratives

### Requirement: Redundant Markdown extras are merged and pruned safely
The project SHALL merge redundant extra Markdown files into domain-level canonical documents and remove obsolete duplicates while preserving traceability.

#### Scenario: Redundant docs are cleaned
- **WHEN** maintainers execute documentation cleanup
- **THEN** duplicated or fragmented extra files are consolidated into one meaningful file per domain topic
- **AND** removed files are either referenced in commit history or replaced by explicit pointers in canonical docs

### Requirement: Consolidated docs preserve delivery traceability
Documentation cleanup SHALL preserve explicit links between challenge requirements, evidence, findings, test results, and debt items.

#### Scenario: Evaluator follows evidence chain
- **WHEN** an evaluator reviews repository documentation
- **THEN** they can navigate from challenge scope to audit findings, quality validation, and debt backlog without broken links
